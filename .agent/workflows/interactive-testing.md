description: Interactive Testing Lifecycle - User-led manual verification before automation
---

This workflow ensures the user is in control of the testing phase and that the agent doesn't perform redundant manual-style actions.

### DEPRECATED - REFER TO MASTER RULES
This workflow has been consolidated into [.agent/project_rules.md](../project_rules.md). 

Follow the **Interactive Testing Lifecycle** defined in the master rules for all testing phases.
